## **3. Key Differences from English**

- **Pronunciation:** Some letters, like **W** (veh) and **V** (fau), are pronounced differently in German.

## **4. Pronunciation Tips**

1. Practice with audio: Listening to native speakers helps understand subtle differences.
2. Focus on Umlauts: Words like **schön** (beautiful) and **schon** (already) have distinct meanings based on Umlauts.
3. Practice ß: Recognize where it’s used (e.g., **heißen** - to be called).
