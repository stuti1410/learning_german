## Explanation
In English, we say **"He" like me**, but **I like "him"**. **He** becomes **him** because of the role it plays.

German does the same thing with words like **ein** and **mein**!

> Ich habe **einen** Bruder.<br>
> I have a brother.

When something is on the receiving end of an action - being loved, being seen, etc. - the word is put in the accusative case, which makes certain words change form!

> Ich liebe **meinen** Mann.<br>
> I love my husband.

### Not everything changes!

In the accusative, only masculine words change form. Others stay the same!

> Meine Tochter liebt **meine** Schwester.<br>
> My daughter loves my sister.
